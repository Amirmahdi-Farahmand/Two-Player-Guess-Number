## 📖 About The Game
In this game, a random number between **1 and 50** is generated by the system.  
Two players take turns guessing the hidden number by clicking on numbers.

After each guess:
- If the number is **too low**, a hint appears on the left side  
- If the number is **too high**, a hint appears on the right side  

The active player is highlighted visually, and each player’s **last guess** is shown.  
The player who guesses the correct number **wins the game**, and a modal displays the winner.  
The game can be restarted anytime using the **Reset** button or by closing the winner modal.
